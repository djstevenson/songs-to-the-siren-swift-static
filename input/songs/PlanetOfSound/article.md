But the alien has what we programmers call an “off by one error”, and arrives at Mars instead - they arrive “somewhere renowned for its canals and colours of red”, before meeting the guy in a rover who tells him “it’s one more over”.

A lot of Pixies fans will prefer the earlier stuff, particularly Doolittle, but Trompe Le Monde was their finest hour for me. A load of tracks about space and aliens - a theme pervasive enough that some called it a “concept album”.

Pixies have more sophisticated songs than this, but this has an energy and some fine lyrics that elevate it towards the upper end of their output. 

An aside: The first time I saw them play was 1st May 1988 at the Town and Country Club, in Kentish Town, London. A truly magical night, they "co-headlined" (supported) Throwing Muses who were promoting their magnificent second album “House Tornado”.
