As the début single from Icelandic band Sugarcubes (originally Sykurmolarnir in their native language), this was the first chance most of us got to hear the inestimable talent of Björk Guðmundsdóttir. Obviously it was released in English too, but the original Icelandic version just sounds perfect to me.
