Lennon apparently took the title of the song from an NRA magazine - “I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something”. The magazine itself was paraphrasing the title of a Charles M Schultz book “Happiness Is A Warm Puppy”.

The meaning of the metaphorical gun in the song has been interpreted as being about heroin (after all, the lyric includes the phrase “I need a fix...”), or about sex. 

This is one of those songs constructed from various disparate ideas glued together. The song changes key and time signature on a whim.  The song tends to be considered to be split into five sections:

 * Intro, “She’s not a girl who misses much”.
 * The band joins in, “She’s well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand”
 * “I need a fix ’cause I’m going down”
 * “Mother Superior jumped the gun”
 * The “doo wop” section (“Bang bang shoot shoot” etc)
 
 The Mother Superior section is the most complex rythmically. 
 
 This is a song where the “parts” are all pretty interesting, and yet summing them together adds a extra layer of interest on top.  For me, by far the finest hour (well 3 minutes) of The Beatles.
