Dobson has toured as a guitar player for The Shins, but has also had a successful (in critical terms at least) career fronting Seattle-based Deep Sea Diver. Wide Awake is from their 2nd LP Secrets (2016), which followed 2012’s début History Speaks.

2020 saw the release of their 3rd LP, Impossible Weight. The ^link(impossible-weight) featured  a vocal contribution from Sharon van Etten - and if ever you need a pointer to something that’s worth listening to, “ft. Sharon van Etten” is a pretty good start.

Drummer in Deep Sea Diver is Dobson’s husband Peter Mansen.  I’ve long planned to include a track from this band, but the reason for doing it *now* was an ^link(talkhouse-article) about being in a band with one’s spouse.

Dobson is a writer/interviewee who is always smart, interesting, and entertaining.
