There are relatively few music artists who, when they are interviewed, or they write an article, can be guaranteed to say something smart, interesting, and entertaining.

I'm thinking of the likes of Michael Stipe, or Kristin Hersh.

And also Jessica Dobson, the singer/songwriter fronting Deep Sea Diver.
