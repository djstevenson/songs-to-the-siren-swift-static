The story behind the song is of an Edwardian-era homing pigeon (a Belgian blue cock, to be precise), who set long distance records in returning to his Derby home from Rome, while very few other birds made the return.

In the 1980s, Dave Sudbury wrote a song about the story of Charlie Hudson’s bird, and the lyrics are quite beautiful.

> If you live ’round here  
> The ground seems awful near  
> Sometimes I need a lift to victory  

Sudbury performed it in a competition in which June Tabor was a judge. She liked the song and recorded it herself, bringing it to a wider audience in 1988.

But it’s this version by North-East England folk band The Unthanks that really appeals to me. Not least due to the brass band accompaniment by the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band - who actually reached the No 2 slot in the UK singles chart in 1977 with a recording of ^link(the-floral-dance) with Terry Wogan (feel free to skip that link, really). It took the "might" of Mull of Kintyre to keep them off top spot.

Ah, 1977 and the glory days of punk, eh?!

The King of Rome (the bird himself) ^link(the-king-of-rome) exists thanks to the magic of taxidermy
