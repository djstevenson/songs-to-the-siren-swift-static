Her father was a native Cornish language speaker, and her mother Welsh. In 2014 she released a solo record mostly in Welsh, but with this closing track in Cornish. The album is inspired by a 1970s Welsh science fiction novel by Owain Owain.

Her ^link(y-dydd-olaf) album is mostly electronic, though Gwenno performs the songs live in a number of formats, sometimes solo with synths and machines, sometimes with a full band and/or a string section.

I can’t tell you what this song is about, but apparently the title translates as “Time”.

In 2018, Gwenno released a full album of Cornish songs, ^link(le-kov).
