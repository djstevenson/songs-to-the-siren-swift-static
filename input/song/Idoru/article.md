Grimes, aka Claire Elise Boucher, is a Canadian electronic/pop artist who came to wide attention in 2012 with her third LP Visions, after signing to 4AD records. The album topped a lot of critics’ polls that year, and the single Genesis, in particular, drew a lot of attention.

Miss Anthropocene is her fifth album, and Idoru is the closing track.  It’s electronic pop with heavily multi-tracked vocals almost reminiscent of a shoe-gazing act.  It’s a beautiful sound, a tremendous mix, and is a song I’m confident will stand the test of time.

This is a highlight of last year for me, along with ^link(time-is-hardcore), by High Contrast ft. Kae Tempest and Anita Bray.
