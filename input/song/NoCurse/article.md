Waxahatchee is the project name for songer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield. At this time she had a steady band line up featuring twin sister Allison (guitar, keys, BVs), along with Katherine Simonetti (bass), and Ashley Arnwine (drums), though Allison does not appear on this recording.

There is a ^link(documentary) about the recording of this song, in which the band seems to imply that this would be part of Out in the Storm. However, it never made it and was a standalone single only.

Crutchfield’s songs are rarely complex in terms of chord structures. It’s rare for her to venture far beyond diatonic Major/minor and this song is basically  ^chord(I) ^chord(V) ^chord(IV) in the verse and ^chord(ii) ^chord(IV) ^chord(V) ^chord(I) in the chorus.   But it’s always the melody that makes the song with Waxahatchee.

One of the great benefits of being relatively simple is that a song can easily adapt to different interpretations. “La Loose”, for example, from 2015’s Ivy Tripp, was releaseed in  ^link(la-loose-electronic) form, but also works well ^link(la-loose-acoustic), and in an ^link(la-loose-indie).
