The Wedding Present were big in indie circles from the mid-80s to mid-90s, perennial favourites of John Peel and his audience. The music was usually upbeat jangly indie, and they made many classics of the genre. The band took a long break before David Gedge re-emerged as Cinerama, mostly avoiding old material in their sets.

However, in 2004, the then-current line-up of Cinerama was renamed The Wedding Present as they embraced the old material again, and new songs were recorded. These became the Take Fountain album.

Take Fountain carried some great singles along side Interstate 5 - ^link(ringway-to-seatac), and ^link(further-north-than-you). All three were apparently influenced by Gedgeâ€™s time living in the north eastern part of the US. (Seatac is Seattle/Tacoma airport, Ringway is now known as Manchester Airport).

The ^link(lp-version) is extended from the 6 minute single. The "mariachi" section at the end initially seemed out of place, but once I got used to it, it seems wrong not to hear it that way!
