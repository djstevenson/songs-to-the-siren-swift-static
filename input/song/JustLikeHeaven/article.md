Released as the third single from ^link(kiss-me), this brought The Cure the sort of popularity in the US that they already had in Europe. 
 
Totally worth watching is ^link(rick-beato) which pulls apart the song part by part, instrument by instrument. Check it out - it's why I'm keeping this write-up short - he says it better than I can.
 
### Covers

Popular (though I'm not much of a fan of it) is a fairly faithful cover by ^link(dinosaur-jr).

More worthy to my ears are covers by ^link(watson-twins) and ^link(katie-melua).
