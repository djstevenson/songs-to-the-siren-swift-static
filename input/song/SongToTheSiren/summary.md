This is the song that gave this blog its title, so it seems right to open with it. Although it's a cover, this is the most famous version and, I'd claim, the definitive version.

Recorded by Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie of 4AD act Cocteau Twins, this was released on the B-side of a 12” release, then the A-side of a 7”, before appearing on the first This Mortal Coil album *It'll End in Tears*
