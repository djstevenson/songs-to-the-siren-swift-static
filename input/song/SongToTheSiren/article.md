This Mortal Coil was a music collective led by Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the British record label ^link(4ad), and featuring a wide variety of artists, many of which were already part of acts signed to that label.

The TMC project kicked off with a re-recording of a pair of Modern English songs, which appeared as a medley on the A-side of a 12” release. The B-side tracks included this version of Song to the Siren. It subsequently became the A-side of a 7” release.

This recording features Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie, both of 4AD band Cocteau Twins.

The original recordings were made in the 1960s by Tim Buckley, this song being written by him and collaborator Larry Beckett.

There are a few different recordings by Buckley, and this cover fairly closely follows the version on ^link(starsailor), with the addition of Fraser’s distinctive vocal style. Buckley had played the song live a few years earlier on ^link(monkees).

There is a haunting quality to the recording, which well matches the lyrics - about a possibly unrequited love, presented in terms of a sailor being drawn onto the rocks by the siren.

### Other versions

The song has seen many covers over the years, from ^link(robert-plant) to ^link(hmhb), from ^link(george-michael) to ^link(wolf-alice). George Michael follows the This Mortal Coil version so closely he even gets the same lyrics wrong (it should be "were you fox when I was hare?"). Robert Plant’s take on the song is a spectacular error of judgement. It’s truly appalling.

The versions by Wolf Alice and ^link(sinead) are my favourites after This Mortal Coil. O’Connor’s version was released on a 2010 compilation of music from Irish Artists, before appearing as a bonus track on the iTunes release of How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?
