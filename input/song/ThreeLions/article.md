David Baddiel and Frank Skinner were presenting the comedy football show Fantasy Football League, and provided the lyrics while Ian Broudie of Lightning Seeds wrote the music.

The song kicks off with samples from commentary etc about how England have been underachieving since the 1966 World Cup win, and the song’s main theme is about the hope and pride us fans feel, despite the disappointments.

“It’s Coming Home” refers to the Euro 96 tournament for which it was written, when England, where modern football was invented, was hosting the tournament. In other tournaments the phrase has been repurposed to indicate, in vain, that England would be bringing the trophy home.  Of course, now we're in 2021, the latter stages of Euro 2020 are again in England.  If you're reading this, we won it...

The title, of course, refers to the official England badge, which in turn is based on traditional England heraldry - it’s basically a take on the second Great Seal of King Richard the Lionheart from the late 12th Century.

The song has been re-released a number of times, and hit the top of the charts again later with tweaked lyrics.

### Preceding England football songs

The association of pop music with football can be traced back to the 1966, when Engllish skiffle artist Lonnie Donegan wrote and sang ^link(world-cup-willie). Named after the mascot of the 66 World Cup, it was the official song of that tournament.

The 1970 England Football Squad, ahead of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, released the sucessful ^link(back-home) record, this being the first such song directly associated with the England team.

In the 70s, England were dire, and failed to qualify for the 1974 (Germany) and 1978 (Argentina) tournaments. In return to the World Cup stage in 1982 (Spain), the squad released ^link(this-time).

The 80s saw some truly appalling efforts. ^link(whole-world) was produced for the 1986 Mexico world cup, while ^link(all-the-way) is surely the worst of all, created with Stock, Aitken and Waterman for Euro 1988 in Germany.

It was in 1990 that everything changed, with the legendary New Order combining with comedian Keith Allen to produce ^link(world-in-motion) with the England squad for the Italia 90 World Cup.  New Order were on top of their game at this time, their classic Technique LP having been released the year before.

Rather than being a whole squad thing, this was more of a conventional pop performance, with the addition of the iconic John Barnes rap.  It did have a sing-along section at the end (“We’re singing for England” etc), but it didn't quite have the simplicity and catchiness of “It’s Coming Home”, so it’s the latter that endures.

### An aside

A lyric in Three Lions mentions "Jules Rimet still gleaming", a reference to the World Cup trophy as presented to England in 1966.  However, the trophy no longer existed at this time. It was given permanently to Brazil in 1970 after their third tournament success, and was subsequently stolen. It is assumed to have been melted down, even though it didn't have much gold content, being made of gold-plated sterling silver.
