Three Lions, I'd argue, is not the greatest football **SONG**, but it's the greatest **FOOTBALL** song.

After some terrible efforts in the 80s, football songs took a significant step forwards when New Order combined with the Italia 90 England squad to release World In Motion.  This, I think, is a better song in general than Three Lions. But the latter, written for euro 96, works better *for football* due to its anthemic sing-along “It’s Coming Home” refrain.
