After the two artists had met while touring with ^link(bonobo), and Yppah invited Anomie Belle to collaborate on a track that became part of Eighty One - and she ended up providing vocals, instrumentation and production to a bunch of songs, including Film Burn.

This is a perfect meld of the two - it slots perfectly into the repertoire of either artist.

I particularly recommend checking out their live ^link(kexp) together, with the amazing Sean Lane on drums.
