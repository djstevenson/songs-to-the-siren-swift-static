Embedded above is the single version (because it has the video), but I prefer the mix of the ^link(album) version.

1999 was a busy year for Allison, releasing her début solo LP only a few weeks after The Contino Sessions came out, featuring her collaboration with Death in Vegas up front.

The song repeats the same line all the way through, but the instrumentation builds up nicely, especially two minutes in when the drum machine loop is joined by “real drums”.

Incidentally, I think I’ve deciphered the lyrics.

> La la la,  
> la la la...
