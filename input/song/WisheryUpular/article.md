His act is to make new music from usually-short snippets taken from the source material, with just a few additions from other instruments, and the results are sometimes quite spectacular. He made his name with ^link(alice), using clips from Disney's Alice in Wonderland.

But here I've highlighted two other songs that are popular favourites.  Wishery is made from clips of Disney's 1937 feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Upular is made from Disney-Pixar's Up (2009). Both tunes stand strongly in their own right, but the samples and video editing add to the joy.
