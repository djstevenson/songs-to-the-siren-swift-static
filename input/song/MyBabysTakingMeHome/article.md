Lil’ Beethoven, their 2002 LP release, stood out as much as ^link(no1-song) did in 1979, and as  ^link(gratuitous) did in 1994.

The electronic pop of its predecessor Balls was swiped away and replaced with a sound that was based mainly around the piano and heavily multi-tracked vocals.

The record didn't really get them back into the big-time sales-wise, but it certainly hit home with music critics, and with the band’s large worldwide fanbase.

A live performance of the record was filmed in March 2004 at the Södra Teatern in Stockholm, Sweden, and the embedded video in this article is from that performance.  The ^link(official) is linked below.
