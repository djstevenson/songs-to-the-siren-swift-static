The lyrics do meander a bit, but it’s basically about the Northern Soul scene that was coming to the end of its popularity in the early 80s as this song was written.  The “Casino” in the title refers to the Northern Soul venue, The ^link(wigan-casino) nightclub. Smith said that he wasn’t putting down the scene and its fans, this was more about documenting its demise.

The drum beat was reportedly an attempt to be a bit “mod”, taking an influence from ^link(let-your-heart-dance) by Secret Affair, a band who achieved brief popularity during the post-punk late-70s Mod revival.
