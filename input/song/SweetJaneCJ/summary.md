A cover of a slower, quieter, version of The Velvet Underground's Sweet Jane, the song's writer Lou Reed has apparently gone on record as saying that this take, by Canadian "alternative country" band Cowboy Junkies, was his favourite. 

This cover is based on the version from the 1969: The Velvet Underground Live LP.
