Although this was the third single from Dummy, which went on to win the 1995 Mercury Music Prize, it was the single that led the surge in popularity for Portishead.

Portishead added some esoteric instrumentation to the usual guitar/bass/drums/keys line-up, and also heavily used samples, often spun in from vinyl by a DJ. The main loop you hear through the track is from Ike's Rap II by Isaac Hayes

The same sample was used by contemporary Bristol artist Tricky on ^link(hell-is-round-the-corner) from his Maxinquaye album.

It has also seen plenty of use since. One fine example is ^link(here). And British professional long-jumper Jazmin Sawyers  sang a nice ^link(sawyers-medley) on The Voice tv show.
