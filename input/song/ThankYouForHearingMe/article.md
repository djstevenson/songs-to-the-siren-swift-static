This track is the final climax of Universal Mother. It has a folky melodic feel, but with a reggae-driven bassline. Her band at this time were awesome, including long-time collaborators John Reynolds on drums, and Clare Kenny on bass.

Reynolds was O’Connor’s producer, and musical director for live shows. And indeed he was also her ex-husband (presumably the person referred to in another favourite, ^link(this-is-the-last-day-of-our-acquaintance)).  He remained in her bands until the end, and is credited as co-writer with O’Connor on this track.

The song is based on her then recent breakup with Peter Gabriel.

B-side was a 13-minute remix of ^link(fire-in-babylon), another track from Universal Mother. I've not heard this remix, but the idea of a 13-minute version of that song certainly whets the appetite, so I'll be checking it out.

RIP Sinéad O’Connor 1966-2023
