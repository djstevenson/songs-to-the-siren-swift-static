Sadly, I write this on the day we learn that Sinéad O’Connor has passed away.

I talked about her covers earlier in this blog, but she was a tremendous songwriter in her own right.  I became a committed fan when I saw her at a festival in 1994 or maybe 1995 when she was promoting Universal Mother, having previously only known her own song Mandinka, and Nothing Compares 2 U, the cover that made her famous.

I was knocked over by this performance of melodic music somehow influenced by folk and dub at the same time.
