Utah Saints released Something Good in 1992 as their second single, and it remains their biggest success. The ^link(cloudbusting) sample “I just know that something good is going to happen” is spun into a house track with some gloriously clichéd house piano sprinkled throughout.

The version that I prefer, however, is the 2008 remix, which was released alongside the award-winning Running Man video. This version had a re-recording of the Kate Bush sample, performed by Davina Perera . I don’t know if this was done for musical or financial reasons, but it does save on royalties (Bush would still have to be paid as writer, but no longer as performer)
