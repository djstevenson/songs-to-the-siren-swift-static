The third song in this trio will feature the two artists working together, but this is from a Yppah solo release on Ninja Tunes - I think this is the first track I heard of his. He is another artist that I picked up on from BBC 6music radio play, and since then he's been a constant favourite - and it was great to see him return with a new record Sunset in the Deep End earlier this year (2020).

Yppah is multi-instrumentalist.producer Joe Corales who specialises in music that often has a basis in electronica, with synths, sequences and loops, but also has an organic feel with plenty of “real” instrumentation too. (Just for the record, as a synth player, I do indeed consider them to be real too!). 

His music is largely instrumental, but sometimes featuring guest vocalists, and sometimes with chopped up vocal samples bringing the human voice to the records in other ways.
