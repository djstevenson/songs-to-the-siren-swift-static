Released in May, this track started as an idea from Van Etten that she handed to Jagjaguwar label-mate Olsen to work on.  The two do their own verses solo, but the harmonies that they sing together in the pre-chorus and chorus work so well, considering the quite-different vocal sounds of each singer.

On the studio version, there’s a Grandaddy-style synth-piano arpeggio that comes in a few times, e.g. at about ^link(arp-at-1-32).  It’s a detail that isn’t required to make it a great song - yet it adds a lovely extra layer on top.

In the video embedded above, look out for Abba-style shots where one singer is face on and the other side on. You’ll know what I mean when you see it. Not least because it’s in the current video thumbnail :)
