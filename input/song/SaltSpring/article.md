I first discovered Belle’s music via her collaboration with ^link(yppah) (more about him very soon!). She featured heavily on his Eighty One LP, released in 2012, contributing vocals, instrumentation and production to several tracks after the two had met while touring with ^link(bonobo).

Flux is her third solo LP, following Sleeping Patterns (2008), and The Crush (2011), and I think it’s her best solo work so far. The style varies between the acoustic piano and voice number The Good Life - to glitchy full-on electronic treatments like ^link(lovers) with its beautiful (but probably NSFW) video.

I also highly recommend checking out ^link(picture-perfect), her collab with Jon Auer of The Posies.
