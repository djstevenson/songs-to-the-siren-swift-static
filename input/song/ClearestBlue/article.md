 I first became aware of Chvrches via the ^link(bbc-sound-of-2013) list, which placed them 5th. It seems low - not just in hindsight, but also at the time, given that ^link(the-mother-we-share) had already been released.
 
 That track clearly remains their most famous, but, three albums in, Clearest Blue is the strongest track for me. It just builds and builds and you think there’s going to be an "everyone goes mad" moment - and then there’s an "everyone goes mad" moment.
 
 Although it doesn’t share the structure and build of the single/album mix, it’s definitely also worth checking out the ^link(gryffin-remix) - a different feel, but also pretty darned awesome.
