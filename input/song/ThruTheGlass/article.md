2004 was a year I was either not working or freelancing form home, so I had time to listen to a lot more radio than normal. And, significantly, in 2003 that DAB radio (for all its technical faults) became mainstream, and I discovered BBC 6 Music.  In the next year or so, my view of the state of music was massively reinvigorated by that radio station. This blog will feature quite a few numbers from the mid-2000s, thanks to 6music.

Thru The Senses was released as a single in spring 2004, presumably without selling in the hoped-for numbers, because after the album release that Autumn, the record company gave it another shot and apparently it troubled the charts this time around. Thankfully, Iâ€™d grown well past caring about the charts by then.

This is hook-laden indie pop at its best.
