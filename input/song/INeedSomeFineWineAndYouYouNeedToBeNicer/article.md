This is not only one if my all time favourite song titles, it also features one of my favourite videos. 

You could think on first listening that maybe the song is about an abusive relationship, but I don't think it is. It's more about a stale one - they've got older and there is still love, they're sticking together through the good times and bad.

Maybe they don't have the same animal passion they once did. Until a few Stellas are sunk...

 > Baby you're foul in clear conditions  
 > But you're handsome in the fog  
 > So I need some fine wine,  
 > And you, you need to be nicer

Sit.
