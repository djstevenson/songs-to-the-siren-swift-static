2021 sees the release of the fourth LP by Chvrches, and the first track released to the public, the heavily-autotuned ^link(he-said-she-said) was, in my view, fairly underwhelming.

But the second teaser from the LP raised the stakes somewhat - a tremendous collaboration with Robert Smith of The Cure. It’s amazing - currently my next favourite Chvrches track after the iconic ^link(clearest-blue) from their 2nd LP Every Open Eye (2015).

When touring their 3rd LP Love Is Dead, Chvrches added a live drummer to their setup. I wasn’t convinced it improved the sound at all. That doesn’t mean I want everything to be programmed, there was just something about that particular combo that didn’t work for me.

I think the drums here are programmed, and there is an electronic element to the backing, but there is well-played live bass, piano, and guitar to help this groove along nicely.

The previous track on this blog, ^link(like-i-used-to), referred to two very different voices working so well together. Here we have the same - but even more so.

Highlight of the year so far.
