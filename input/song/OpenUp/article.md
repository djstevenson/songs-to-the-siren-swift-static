During his time with Public Image Ltd, Lydon had a collab with Afrika Bambaataa's electro project Time Zone. ^link(world-destruction) (1984) had a “rock/rap” crossover  sound that Run DMC would take to massive success.

But PiL were winding down in the early 90s, after popularity (and, let’s face it, quality of output) declined after much success in the late 70s and the 80s.  Lydon was gearing up for some reunion shows with the original Pistols line-up, but during that post-PiL, pre-Pistols, gap he produced one of his finest works.

Combining a perfect 90s dance beat and synths from Leftfield, with one of Lydon’s finest vocal performances, the result was Open Up, which still sounds amazing .

Open Up remains a highlight of Lydon's shows to this day, as he performs again as Public Image Ltd.
