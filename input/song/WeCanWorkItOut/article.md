Although "Lennon and McCartney" appear on the credits to songs written by only one of them, this was a genuine co-composition. According to Wikipedia, this is McCartney wrote most of it before enlisting Lennon to help finish it off, but Macca credits George Harrison with the idea to waltz-time the end of the "Life is very short" section (where it goes "and fighting my friend").

This is when the song-writing became a little more sophisticated and, for me, way more interesting.  (I’ll do a piece on Happiness is a Warm Gun at some point - that’s crazily all over the place - in a good way).
