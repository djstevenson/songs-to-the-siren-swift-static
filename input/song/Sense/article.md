The official video upload to YouTube is of appalling quality, so I’ve embedded a third-party upload above. 

I liked a lot about The Lightning Seeds, not least Broudie’s ability to attract top class collaborators like Terry Hall and Ian McNabb of The Icicle Works.  

Hall himself has also worked with plenty of other artists I love, including a cute version of ^link(all-kinds-of-everything), with Sinéad O’Connor.

See the links below for Terry Hall performing Sense live with a ^link(supergroup) line-up, including Chris Sharrock on drums (The Icicle Works, World Party, Oasis, etc), Will Sergeant on bass (Echo & the Bunnymen), and Craig Gannon on guitar (The Bluebells, The Smiths, Morrissey). I’m not 100% sure on the keyboard player but I *think* it’s Angie Pollock (Goldfrapp, Peter Gabriel, etc).
