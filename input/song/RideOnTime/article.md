(This official video sounds like the re-recorded version with Heather Small doing the vocals.  The person miming in the video is a model, and is neither Heather Small nor Loleatta Holloway).

The producers of this record took samples from an ^link(acapella) of Hollowayâ€™s disco track ^link(love-sensation), and added the classic elements of Italian House, including the 909 drums and all-important Korg M-1 piano riff.  The result was a number one hit in the UK, the biggest result for any of track from the then-popular Italian House movement.

The title reportedly comes from the Italian producers mis-hearing the Right On Time line from the original.

After Holloway sued for unauthorised use of her recording, the track was re-made with Heather Small trying to emulate the original artist.
