The best copy of the official video I found is well ropey in terms of video quality, but it still a fun watch. Also worth checking out is this ^link(live-performance) - full of energy that the VHS artefacts can't stifle.
 
 If this appeals to you in any way, totally worth checking out is ^link(the-punk-singer-trailer), a fabulous documentary about Bikini Kill and Le Tigre singer Kathleen Hanna.
