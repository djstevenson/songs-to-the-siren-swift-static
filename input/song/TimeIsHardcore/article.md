The result is one of the highlights of 2020 for me. It starts off with Tempest’s rap thing over a beat that is soon accompanied by synth snippets from Gosh by Jamie XX.  This synth sample continues over most of the song, including a chorus sung by Bray.

As the song progresses, Tempest ups their word rate, and that’s really what makes the song build, as much as anything.

There’s not really a lot to say here  - good beats, great spoken and sung vocals, and that wonderful synth sound from Gosh. In my top two of 2020, along with ^link(idoru) by Grimes.

Time Is Hardcore was released as a single in September 2020, and appeared on the Notes From the Underground LP two months later.
