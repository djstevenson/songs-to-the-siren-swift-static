The Go-Go’s released it as a single from their début album Beauty and The Beat in 1981, and it became a minor hit in a few countries, including the UK. It achieved greater success in Australia and Canada.

I definitely prefer this take to the ^link(fb3) version that Hall himself made a year or two later.

I might claim, rightly or wrongly, that some tracks on this blog are truly revolutionary pieces of art. But this one isn’t.  It’s just a decent pop tune.  But it’s a record that, whenever it crops up on “shuffle”, it brings a smile to my face. 

Plenty of out-and-out “pop” singers have had a go at this, including ^link(hilary-duff).  These versions are uniformly terrible.
