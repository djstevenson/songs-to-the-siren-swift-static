Richard X rose to fame as a pioneer of the mash-up scene, particularly with his pairing of Adina Howard’s ^link(freak-like-me) with samples from Tubeway Army’s ^link(are-friends-electric) to create ^link(we-dont-give-a-damn-about-our-friends), released under the artist name Girls On Top.

Here he bases a new song around a sample from ^link(fade-into-you) by Mazzy Star, along with new music and a vocal from Jarvis Cocker.

Cocker is at his finest here, both in terms of his tone and the melody. And the combination of his voice with that of Hope Sandoval from Mazzy Star is just sublime.

This really is one of my all-time favourites.
