This is the point at which I introduce you to my all-time favourite band. Some of their finest stuff isn’t that easily accessible - but this is the song I’d use to introduce a new listener. It’s  After their début album Throwing Muses, and in a highly-productive era before the follow up House Tornado, the band produced some of their finest work  - the ^link(chains-changed-ep), the Fat Skier mini-album, and this track - their contribution to the 4AD compilation album ^link(lonely-is-an-eyesore).

If you’ve been in the same room as me when my phone has gone off, and I’ve forgotten to put it on silent, you’ve heard the intro to this song - I sampled it for my ring tone. In retrospect, this wasn’t a good idea. If listening to my music on shuffle in the car, when I hear this I have an inevitable moment about confusion over whether it’s just the song or I have a phone call.

### An aside
 
 Going back to my opening point about what track you’d play first to someone who doesn’t know your favourite band: I had a conversation with my (then) boss at work when I booked time off to follow a mini-tour of the UK by Throwing Muses. He didn’t know the band, so fired up Spotify, listened to 30 seconds of the “most popular” track and said “It’s a bit 90s, isn’t it?” and hit stop.
 
 I relate this anecdote cos the track recommended by Spotify was ^link(not-too-soon), a massively untypical track by a different singer and writer than the main body of work. I quite like the song, but as any aficionado of any band will tell you, don’t start with the most popular song. A Radiohead nut isn’t going to kick you off with Creep, and a New Order fan won’t start you on Blue Monday.
 
 Oh, and Not Too Soon was released in 1990. So sound 1990s isn’t the insult he was looking for :)
 
 If anyone reading this listens to Fish and likes it, and wants to hear more - just ^link(ask-me) or check out the amazing ^link(chains-changed-ep).
