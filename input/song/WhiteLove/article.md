I've read an interview where members of One Dove expressed displeasure at this Hague remix. But I think it's amazing. The song appeared on the album in a longer and less "pop" form - the ten minute ^link(guitar-paradise-mix) - with the single versions of White Love and Breakdown added as CD bonus tracks.

The way I like to listen to this is to play the Radio mix right after the ^link(piano-reprise) that I guess closes the vinyl release of Morning Dove White. 

Then go back to play Breakdown which separates them on the CD version.

The band broke up after this album, Allison going on to have a ^link(solo), and to ^link(guest) Death in Vegas.
