Songs that I love.</p><p class="body-text">Given the title, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that we’ll kick off with Song To The Siren.</p><p class="body-text">The update rate will vary - I’ll add new articles on a whim, basically.</p><p class="body-text">There will be a lot of “indie with female vocalists” cos that’s my bag, but there will be some variety too - I’m listening to way more instrumental music than I used to, for example.</p><p class="body-text">I tend to listen mostly to “current” music, but there won’t be so many recent songs on this blog, because, for a song to be written up here, it needs to be something I’ve lived with for a while, and that I know won’t be something I’m likely to tire of soon.</p><p class="body-text">The working title for the blog was “Songs I’ll Never Tire Of” - a terrible name with arguably dodgy grammar.  It was accurate to the intent, though. The title didn’t stick, but the principle will.</p><h3 class="mdh3">Privacy</h3><p class="body-text">No cookies are set. There is no longer a login, so no information about you is requested at all. The earlier version of this site had logins for comments, but they weren’t used much so I removed them, and, by the time this ’static’ version of the site is live, that data will have been destroyed.</p><h3 class="mdh3">Source code</h3><p class="body-text">The site is served as static HTML etc files. However, the source material is a combination of Markdown documents and metadata that’s stored as Swift objects.  Swift code generates the static site when I do updates, and this static version gets uploaded.</p><p class="body-text">The code behind the old dynamic version can be found on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/djstevenson/songs-to-the-siren">GitHub</a>.</p><p class="body-text">The static site generate in use now can be found on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/djstevenson/songs-to-the-siren-swift-static">GitHub</a> also.</p><h3 class="mdh3">FAQ</h3><p class="body-text">Q: Why does it look so awful?</p><p class="body-text">A: I make no claims to be a designer, sorry :)</p><p class="body-text">Q: Have you tested it for readability for people with various forms of colour-blindness?</p><p class="body-text">A: Not yet, but it is something I intend to do as soon as I can. If anyone is in a position to report any such issues, please reached out to me david (at) ytfc.com - thanks. I’ll be testing for other accessibility requirements too.</p><p class="body-text">Q: Why is it all old music?</p><p class="body-text">A: I’m old (born 1962). But as it happens, more than a lot of people of my age, I tend to listen mostly to new stuff. However, the original idea behind this blog was, as mentioned above, to list songs I know I’ll always love. And you have to live with a song for some time to know if it’s one you will never tire of.</p><h3 class="mdh3">Author</h3><p class="body-text">David Stevenson, currently residing in Oxford, UK.</p><p class="body-text"><a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hoagy_ytfc">@hoagy_ytfc on Twitter</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
