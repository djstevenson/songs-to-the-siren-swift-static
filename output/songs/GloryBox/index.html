Grunge was still hanging in there, but this really was something new, and Portishead were at the forefront of it.  This song is built on an Isaac Hayes sample that became quite ubiquitous, and is still making an impact on popular music today.</p></div><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4qQyUi4zfDs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div><p>Although this was the third single from Dummy, which went on to win the 1995 Mercury Music Prize, it was the single that led the surge in popularity for Portishead.</p><p>Portishead added some esoteric instrumentation to the usual guitar/bass/drums/keys line-up, and also heavily used samples, often spun in from vinyl by a DJ. The main loop you hear through the track is from Ike's Rap II by Isaac Hayes</p><p>The same sample was used by contemporary Bristol artist Tricky on <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/E3R_3h6zQEs" target="_blank">Hell is Round the Corner</a> from his Maxinquaye album.</p><p>It has also seen plenty of use since. One fine example is <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/UKp2CrfmVfw" target="_blank">Here by Alessia Cara</a>. And British professional long-jumper Jazmin Sawyers  sang a nice <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/7BQAoOriwqI" target="_blank">Here / Glory Box medley</a> on The Voice tv show.</p></div><div><h5><a id="song-12" class="link" href="../SilentNight/index.html">7 O'Clock News/Silent Night</a></h5><h5><a id="song-14" class="link" href="../WeCanWorkItOut/index.html">We Can Work It Out</a></h5></div><div><h4>Tags</h4><ul><li>Bristol</li><li>Isaac Hayes</li><li>Sample</li><li>Trip Hop</li><li>1990s</li></ul></div><div><h4>Origin</h4><ul><li>ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</li></ul></div><div><h4>Links</h4><ul><li><a id="link-yt" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qQyUi4zfDs" target="_blank">Glory Box - Portishead</a></li><li><a id="link-hell-is-round-the-corner" class="link" href="https://youtu.be/E3R_3h6zQEs" target="_blank">Hell Is Round The Corner - Tricky</a></li><li><a id="link-here" class="link" href="https://youtu.be/UKp2CrfmVfw" target="_blank">Here - Alessia Cara</a></li><li><a id="link-sawyers-medley" class="link" href="https://youtu.be/7BQAoOriwqI" target="_blank"> Here / Glory Box - Jazmin Sawyers</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
