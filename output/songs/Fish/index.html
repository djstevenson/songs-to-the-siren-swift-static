Some of their finest stuff isn't that easily accessible - but this is the song I'd use to introduce a new listener. It's  After their dÃ©but album Throwing Muses, and in a highly-productive era before the follow up House Tornado, the band produced some of their finest work  - the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed" target="_blank">Chains Changed EP</a>, the Fat Skier mini-album, and this track - their contribution to the 4AD compilation album <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Is_an_Eyesore" target="_blank">Lonely Is an Eyesore</a>.</p><p>If you've been in the same room as me when my phone has gone off, and I've forgotten to put it on silent, you've heard the intro to this song - I sampled it for my ring tone. In retrospect, this wasn't a good idea. If listening to my music on shuffle in the car, when I hear this I have an inevitable moment about confusion over whether it's just the song or I have a phone call.</p><h3>An aside</h3><p>Going back to my opening point about what track you'd play first to someone who doesn't know your favourite band: I had a conversation with my (then) boss at work when I booked time off to follow a mini-tour of the UK by Throwing Muses. He didn't know the band, so fired up Spotify, listened to 30 seconds of the "most popular" track and said "It's a bit 90s, isn't it?" and hit stop.</p><p>I relate this anecdote cos the track recommended by Spotify was <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/=RZI-FTcFtn8" target="_blank">Not Too Soon</a>, a massively untypical track by a different singer and writer than the main body of work. I quite like the song, but as any aficionado of any band will tell you, don't start with the most popular song. A Radiohead nut isn't going to kick you off with Creep, and a New Order fan won't start you on Blue Monday.</p><p>Oh, and Not Too Soon was released in 1990. So sound 1990s isn't the insult he was looking for :)</p><p>If anyone reading this listens to Fish and likes it, and wants to hear more - just <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hoagy_ytfc" target="_blank">ask me</a> or search for the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed" target="_blank">Chains Changed EP</a>.</p></div><div><h5><a id="song-14" class="link" href="../WeCanWorkItOut/index.html">We Can Work It Out</a></h5><h5><a id="song-16" class="link" href="../INeedSomeFineWineAndYouYouNeedToBeNicer/index.html">I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer</a></h5></div><div><h4>Tags</h4><ul><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">4AD</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">1980s</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">Compilation Album</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">Lonely Is An Eyesore</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">Ring Tone</a></li></ul></div><div><h4>Origin</h4><ul><li><a class="tag-link" href="xyzzy.html">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</a></li></ul></div><div><h4>Links</h4><ul><li><a id="link-fish" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIYkd9nJLJA" target="_blank">Fish - Throwing Muses</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/=RZI-FTcFtn8" target="_blank">Not Too Soon - Throwing Muses</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed" target="_blank">Chains Changed EP - Throwing Muses</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Is_an_Eyesore" target="_blank">Lonely Is an Eyesore - 4AD compilation</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
