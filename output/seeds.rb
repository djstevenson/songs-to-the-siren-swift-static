This is the song that gave this blog its title, so it seems right to open with it. Although it’s a cover, this is the most famous version and, I’d claim, the definitive version.

Recorded by Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie of 4AD act Cocteau Twins, this was released on the B-side of a 12” release, then the A-side of a 7”, before appearing on the first This Mortal Coil album *It’ll End in Tears*

"""

let article = """
This Mortal Coil was a music collective led by Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the British record label ^link(4ad), and featuring a wide variety of artists, many of which were already part of acts signed to that label.

The TMC project kicked off with a re-recording of a pair of Modern English songs, which appeared as a medley on the A-side of a 12” release. The B-side tracks included this version of Song to the Siren. It subsequently became the A-side of a 7” release.

This recording features Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie, both of 4AD band Cocteau Twins.

The original recordings were made in the 1960s by Tim Buckley, this song being written by him and collaborator Larry Beckett.

There are a few different recordings by Buckley, and this cover fairly closely follows the version on ^link(starsailor), with the addition of Fraser’s distinctive vocal style. Buckley had played the song live a few years earlier on ^link(monkees).

There is a haunting quality to the recording, which well matches the lyrics - about a possibly unrequited love, presented in terms of a sailor being drawn onto the rocks by the siren.

### Other versions

The song has seen many covers over the years, from ^link(robert-plant) to ^link(hmhb), from ^link(george-michael) to ^link(wolf-alice). George Michael follows the This Mortal Coil version so closely he even gets the same lyrics wrong (it should be “were you fox when I was hare?”).

Robert Plant’s take on the song is a spectacular error of judgement. It’s truly appalling.

The versions by Wolf Alice and ^link(sinead) are my favourites after This Mortal Coil. O’Connor’s version was released on a 2010 compilation of music from Irish Artists, before appearing as a bonus track on the iTunes release of How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?

### See also

This Mortal Coil would later cover another Buckley song - ^link(morning-glory) appeared on the second TMC album Filigree & Shadow, with lead vocals by Louise Rutkowski.

Garbage was formed by Butch Vig, producer of Nirvana’s massively successful Nevermind, and along with other US musicians they approached Scot singer Shirley Manson, who I had seen playing in Goodbye Mr McKenzie where she took keyboard and backing vocal duties. Vig and Co reportedly approached her after seeing her lead ^link(angelfish).

I’ve only seen Garbage live a few times, and sadly I’ve not yet seen them nail this live.  That doesn’t diminish the value of the records though.

This is a song in three movements from the Canadian band’s second album. It doesn’t have a conventional verse-chorus structure - it’s more like a linear piece with three distinct sections.

 I first heard this on Round Table on BBC 6 Music. It starts off kinda Morrissey-esque - and to be honest my initial thought was that it there nothing special here. But my feelings for this song grew as that section of the song developed, and two minutes in it goes into the second movement. Not only is this section more uplifting, but the contrast also seems to give joy of the first part.
 
 And then it dramatically shifts up again at 3:20 (album version, it’s about 2:50 in the edited version in the linked video), and this is where I distinctly recall falling so madly in love with this song on that first listen.
 
 Of course, I go back now and wonder how the first section seemed disappointing at first. Maybe it’s just that it’s less hook-laden so it took more time - or maybe it’s the contrast of the other sections that put it in context.
 
 Either way, this song is a total joy.

let article = """
The Heart Throbs nearly hit the big time, but in the ended faded away, sadly. One of my all-time favourite acts, I’d seen them play more times than  I’ve seen any band except Throwing Muses.  This song, in two versions, bookends their second album Jubilee Twist.

Their first album ^link(cleopatra-grip) was a massive critical hit and was high in the Indie charts for quite some time. They were the darlings of the music press (Melody Maker, at least) for a while, but the popularity faded. Not with me, but in general.

The follow-up, ^link(jubilee-twist) featured relatively popular singles like ^link(hooligan) and ^link(bright-green-day), but just like their first LP, the best track to me was the non-single opener.  On Cleopatra Grip, that opener was ^link(tossed-away). For the second album, it’s this featured track, Tiny Feet. The record also closes with a ^link(reprise), which fades in where the opener fades out, carries it on a bit and stops.

The track that is top of my personal play-list is an edit I made myself cross-fading the two together into one. It seems reasonable to assume to assume the song was recorded as a single piece.  I tried contacting the band to get permission to upload the edit, not had a response yet.

It’s a fairly simple melody, but it has quite a groove, and the thing that really caps it is the production/mix.  As you get to the end (especially with the reprise section edited in) more and more is thrown at it in terms of vocal and guitar dubs, yet the mix is so pure and clean all the way through. Every new bit they add can be heard along with what was there before. It’s a masterpiece of mixing.

As an aside, the band announced in advance of a London show (The Garage, if I recall correctly) that it was to be their last ever.  The sadness was tempered a little by how much I enjoyed the support band - a very early-career Sleeper.

But the alien has what we programmers call an “off by one error”, and arrives at Mars instead - they arrive “somewhere renowned for its canals and colours of red”, before meeting the guy in a rover who tells him “it’s one more over”.

A lot of Pixies fans will prefer the earlier stuff, particularly Doolittle, but Trompe Le Monde was their finest hour for me. A load of tracks about space and aliens - a theme pervasive enough that some called it a “concept album”.

Pixies have more sophisticated songs than this, but this has an energy and some fine lyrics that elevate it towards the upper end of their output. 

An aside: The first time I saw them play was 1st May 1988 at the Town and Country Club, in Kentish Town, London. A truly magical night, they “co-headlined” (supported, basically) Throwing Muses who were promoting their magnificent second album “House Tornado”.

 Talking of toms... The drums on this were played by Keith Forsey. Apart from a few syndrum-type sounds, it’s real drums all the way through on this track. He had played on Giorgio Moroder’s earlier Donna Summer productions where he only played part of the kit while most of the percussion was synthesiser-based.  Live drums on ’electronic’ tracks were, at this time, quite common. After all, drum machines didn’t sound great unless you _wanted_ an artificial sound - until the LinnDrum LM-1 in 1982. Forsey later had success as the writer of Don’t You Forget About Me for the Breakfast Club movie, eventually recorded by Simple Minds, who had massive hit with it after other artists turned it down.
 
 For a while in the early 2000s, Sparks live shows included Part 1 of Number One Song In Heaven ^link(segued) into Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth instead of Part 2 -  Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth will almost certainly get a feature on this blog at a later date, as will newer material from the ever-interesting Sparks.

This song was released only a few months before Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, and although it doesn’t have the complexity of songwriting of the latter, I’d suggest that it is an even more astounding leap forward in the state of the art of sound production.

"""

let article = """
For a short period in the mid 70s, after I’d grown out of glam etc, and before punk changed everything, 10cc was my favourite band. Even for those of us who knew they could do such a wide variety of things, this song was quite something.

The unique sound comes from something that would be relatively simple these days - now you sample voices and make loops in Logic or ProTools. Back then, “sampling” involved recording to tape, and “looping” meant physically splicing a tape and joining the ends to make an actual loop. This was then wound around all sorts of mic stand or other apparatus to try to keep it at the right tension as it fed through  the tape machines. They then had, basically “all” notes (well, a full scale’s worth) playing at once, and used the faders to bring notes in and out. Want a A minor chord? Push up the faders on the tape machines playing the A/C/E loops, and leave the rest pulled back. According to a ^link(documentary) at times _all_ faders were pushed up a bit for some sections, to get the massive sound you hear particularly at the fade point.

This song isn’t “good” because of the production. What makes it appealing is the melody, harmony and lyrics. But what makes it _unique_ is the production. There are other special elements too. People notice (rightly) the breathy “Be quiet. Big boys don’t cry” whisper in the Middle 8 (mimed by Eric Stewart in the video but actually performed by the studio secretary Cathy Redfern) - but equally noteworthy at that point is the ^link(bass-solo) in the same section, played by (I think) Eric Stewart’s co-writer Graham Gouldman.

### Star Me Kitten

The R.E.M. song Star Me Kitten, from Automatic for the People, used a technique heavily influenced by I’m Not in Love.  Mike Mills created vocal sample loops, had them all running at once, and “played” the chords via mixer faders, as per 10cc. They even took this on the road - when they went back on tour after the Monster release, Star Me Kitten was played this way live.

The carol Silent Night was written around 1820 for voice and guitar, originally in German. Here it is performed with the usual English translation in two-part harmony, but with piano as the accompanying instrument.

Records of this era often used stereo in a very simplistic way, and this is the same but it works so well here. The piano is on the left, the vocals centre, and the news bulletin on the right. The news reading fades in through the song, starting in the background and becoming gradually dominant.

The stories covered by the bulletin are:

 * A compromise being made in President Johnson’s civil rights bull, where he wanted a total end to discrimination in housing, but needed to back off to get it through.
 * The death of comedian Lenny Bruce.
 * A planned protest march led by Martin Luther King Jr, which was to be met by the National Guard.
 * Indictment of serial killer Richard Speck.
 * Protests at government hearings into protests against the Vietnam War.
 * Richard Nixon urging an increase in the Vietnam war effort.

This is the point at which I introduce you to my all-time favourite band. Some of their finest stuff isn’t that easily accessible - but this is the song I’d use to introduce a new listener. It’s  After their début album Throwing Muses, and in a highly-productive era before the follow up House Tornado, the band produced some of their finest work  - the ^link(chains-changed-ep), the Fat Skier mini-album, and this track - their contribution to the 4AD compilation album ^link(lonely-is-an-eyesore).

If you’ve been in the same room as me when my phone has gone off, and I’ve forgotten to put it on silent, you’ve heard the intro to this song - I sampled it for my ring tone. In retrospect, this wasn’t a good idea. If listening to my music on shuffle in the car, when I hear this I have an inevitable moment about confusion over whether it’s just the song or I have a phone call.

### An aside
 
 Going back to my opening point about what track you’d play first to someone who doesn’t know your favourite band: I had a conversation with my (then) boss at work when I booked time off to follow a mini-tour of the UK by Throwing Muses. He didn’t know the band, so fired up Spotify, listened to 30 seconds of the “most popular” track and said “It’s a bit 90s, isn’t it?” and hit stop.
 
 I relate this anecdote cos the track recommended by Spotify was ^link(not-too-soon), a massively untypical track by a different singer and writer than the main body of work. I quite like the song, but as any aficionado of any band will tell you, don’t start with the most popular song. A Radiohead nut isn’t going to kick you off with Creep, and a New Order fan won’t start you on Blue Monday.
 
 Oh, and Not Too Soon was released in 1990. So sound 1990s isn’t the insult he was looking for :)
 
 If anyone reading this listens to Fish and likes it, and wants to hear more - just ^link(ask-me) or check out the amazing ^link(chains-changed-ep).

It’s On was the first single from Camden-based Flowered Up, being released in 1990 on (then new) Heavenly Records.  The music press was raving about them to a crazy degree, and they couldn’t possibly live up to the hype. Then they actually released a record and the “hype” turned out to be bang on.  Having said that, I don’t think they came up with anything as good as this again until the epic Weekender (more on that later on this blog, for sure).

Critics would dismiss them as a southern copy of Happy Mondays. Although that seemed unfair, the presence of the Bez-like Barry Mooncult in their live setup certainly contributed to that popular view.

The video for this is great, just a band miming to their track about scoring and dealing drugs and that, while cute kids and dogs dance around. It didn’t get aired much at the time but it remains one of my favourite pop videos.

Sadly, their openness to drugs brought about their demise. Literally. Singer Liam Maher, and his guitarist brother Joe were to die young from heroin overdoses.  

Don’t do drugs kids.

Just three years after John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) walked out on the Sex Pistols, he was releasing his third PiL album.  Moving on from the dub/disco/krautrock influences of Metal Box, The Flowers of Romance was even more experimental. Largely led by huge drum sounds and percussion loops, the sound influenced artists well beyond the punk and post-punk scenes.

"""

let article = """
Flowers of Romance (the single doesn’t have the definite article that is found in the album title) preceded the LP.  The single was quite a different mix to that ^link(on-the-album), but both versions have loops of percussion, violin, and other instruments, while Lydon wails over it with lyrics about a failed romance.

The drum sound (I think a combination of multi-tracking, heavy compression, gated reverb, and other effects) was reportedly influenced by Peter Gabriel’s work - while Phil Collins hired the Flowers Of Romance engineer Nick Launay after hearing this record.

Also worth noting is that Jah Wobble, so vital to the sound of Metal Box, left the band before this follow-up. And the result is an album largely without bass guitar. The bottom-end is filled in with percussion and loops of cello etc.

This is also getting into the era where loops don’t have to be literal loops of tape spliced end-back-to-beginning, but digital delays and samplers could do the job. The AMS digital delay, so crucial to Joy Division’s sound, took  a different but equally effective rôle here.

After a disco period, Jamaican model and singer Grace Jones brought out a dub-heavy reggae album of covers in 1980, and had a hit single with her version of The Pretenders song Private Life.

Early punk had a large crossover with reggae music - stemming largely from DJs like ^link(don-letts), whose club nights in Brixton found an audience appreciative of both genres.  

Many punk bands showed reggae influences, ^link(the-ruts) and ^link(slf) would play originals and/or covers from the genre, while PiL’s second album Metal Box was heavily influenced by dub. ^link(the-clash) would play plenty of reggae too, and the one time I saw them live they even had Mikey Dredd supporting them on tour.

Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders was also in on this scene, and their 1980 album Pretenders included her own composition ^link(private-life-pretenders) in a Jamaican style. Very soon after that album was released, Grace Jones was recording with dub and reggae legends ^link(sly-and-robbie), and included a cover of Private Life on her own LP.  It was a hit and still sounds amazing to me now.

Following on from the wildly experimental concept album ^link(gospel) , The Stranglers continued their shift well away from punk with the 1981 album ^link(la-folie). Early in 1982, Golden Brown was released as a single from this record.  It’s a great tune with many hooks - but one of the first hooks you notice is the extra beat in the intro. Like ^link(supervixen), this one hits you right in the opening few seconds.

This is the first song of a pair - this song is enhanced by an added beat, while the next is enhanced by a missed beat.

In 1976/7, I was busy championing the punk movement and how it allowed anyone to have a go, regardless of whether you could really play or not. And yet, although I didn’t realise at the time, the bands I loved most were the ones who *could* actually play pretty well. And those acts generally moved on from punk pretty quickly.

The Stranglers were one of these bands who moved on. They were also pretty prolific. La Folie was their sixth album, released a bit over four years after their début Rattus Norvegicus. It came only nine months after the Meninblack.

Golden Brown is about the apparent pleasures of taking heroin. I’ll take their word for it. Lyricist Hugh Cornwell says it’s also “about a girl”, and how both the drug and the woman provided him joy.

The intro is on harpsichord and synth, and the song is in ^time(3|4) time but there is the occasional bar of 4 beats. Basically, the intro repeats four bars of ^time(3|4), ^time(3|4), ^time(3|4), and ^time(4|4), switching to conventional ^time(3|4) a little before the vocals start.

There are plenty of other songs that add beats here and there, and it’s worth checking out David Bennett’s ^link(david-bennett-analysis) of some of them. He talks about examples from The Beatles, Abba, Björk, and Pink Floyd. He also talks about Golden Brown itself in ^link(david-bennett-analysis-golden-brown).

### Update 4th May 2020 - Dave Greenfield

I just heard the news that Dave Greenfield, who wrote and played the iconic keyboard part on this song, passed away yesterday, aged 71,  after contracting COVID-19. RIP Dave.

Another landmark record in terms of production, this is one of those records that still sounds amazing over 40 years on. Like the previous song on this blog, it has a hook whereby the time signature sometimes changes. Golden Brown adds an extra beat here and there, but Heart of Glass skips a beat. Reportedly the result of an editing accident which was kept when it sounded great, the result is an iconic “middle 8” section which sounds wrong when repeated in normal time in an extended version.

Like the previously mentioned act The Strangers, Blondie were a band with punk origins who could play well enough to progress on from that genre pretty quickly. With ^link(mike-chapman) producing, this song was, according to the song’s writers Debbie Harry and Chris Stein, a tune they had lying around for a while that they couldn’t find the right way finish. Towards the end of the Parallel Lines sessions, Chapman heard their demo. It had a reggae-ish feel, and was known as “Once I Had A Love”. Chapman saw something in it, and wanted to work on it straight away. He and the band brought a disco feel to it, and they made a massive hit.

Recording it took some time. To ensure full separation of each part of his kit, drummer Clem Burke had to record just the bass drum for the whole song, then just the snare, etc. Nowadays you’d program this with loops/samples and do it in no time, but this was a time-consuming and laborious manual process - the record precedes the Linn Drum by a few years.

Although there’s no Linn Drum but there is of course actually some drum machine on it - rather obviously so, that’s how it starts. A preset on the Roland CR-78, played at a higher than normal tempo, plays all the way through alongside the “real” drums.

Every instrument has a hook here. There’s the “sequenced” synths before sequencers were really a thing, there is Frank Infante’s muted lead guitar melodic lines all the way through, and  some gloriously clichéd disco bass from Nigel Harrison, all this from a band that was considered punk not long before.  And what matters most is the vocals - Harry delivered  a deliciously sweet high voice performance, far from the shouty angry thing that punk tended to be.  And with lyrics that carried an edge for those times (the “soon turned out to be a pain in the ass” line had to be replaced in the radio edit, if I recall correctly).

The skipped beat is in what we old-timers call the “middle 8”, the instrumental section that breaks up the verse-chorus-repeat structure. It starts ^link(middle-8) into the official video.

This, to me, is truly one of the greatest pop records of all time. If I ever say I’m tired of this, you can pull the plug, I’m done.

There are plenty of other songs that skip beats here and there, and it’s worth checking out David Bennett’s analyses (^link(db-1) and ^link(db-2))  of some of them. He talks about Heart of Glass, and other examples from Arrows (covered by Joan Jett), The Beatles, Aretha Franklin, Panic at the Disco, Johnny Cash, Green Day, Labi Siffre.

Slade were stylistically lumped in with the UK ’glam’ movement, but they were streets ahead of some of the producer-led fodder like The Sweet. These two singles came out as their peak popularity was waning, but this is a pair of fine tracks from the surprisingly good Slade in Flame film.

"""

let article = """
Glam was more of a fashion thing than a music style - it included producer-led pop hit machines like The Sweet or Gary Glitter (who never got to play on most of their records), but also included more creative artists such as Bowie and Roxy Music. For a period, Slade were the most successful of all, with a string of hits mainly penned by bassist Jim Lea, with singer Noddy Holder providing lyrical input.

Slade produced hit after hit in the early 70s, and as the mid-decade period approached they looked for other outlets, and took on a movie project. This became Slade in Flame, a pretty gritty story of the formation of Flame, a fictional band played by the four members of Slade. In the movie, Flame were to hit the big time quickly, only to be hit by violence, and off-stage legal and financial battles, eventually leading them to split. It’s a hard-hitting look at the less glamorous side of the music biz.

By the time it came out, the band’s popularity was waning, but two of the songs from this movie are among the band’s finest work.  A common theme to their material had become life on the road - singing about things they got up to, or the loved ones left at home.  Far Far Away talks about the great places visited on tour while concluding that the “call of home is loud”.

^link(how-does-it-feel)

How Does It Feel? was a musical change of direction.  Led by Lea’s piano, the song features brass and even flute.  But I think it’s the vocal melody and performance that makes it sound so great.

I’m definitely not an aficionado of classical music, so it’s probably inevitable that my tastes in contemporary classical are at the more populist end of the scale, but this is a beautiful, emotional, piece. You probably wouldn’t file it under “easy listening”, though.

let article = """
Composed by Poland’s Henryk Góecki in 1976, and receiving its première in April the following year, the work (Op 36) is often known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.

Described as “austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes”, the sombre orchestra accompanies a solo Soprano singing in Polish. The first movement features words from a 15th Century Polish lament, while the second is based on a message written on the wall of a WW2 Gestapo cell by a young woman.  This is presented from the point of view of a child separated from her mother.

The third movement features words from a folk song in which a mother searches for her son lost in post-WW1 battles which resulted from the resulting land allocations around the Polish/German borders.

It’s definitely not “easy listening” even for those of us who don’t understand the words.  And yet the music has a sombre beauty, and the soprano is quite stunning, especially when performed by Dawn Upshaw, in the popular 1992 version. 

Beth Gibbons of ^link(portishead) released a live version of this symphony, with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra.

If you want to check it out, I suggest starting with the popular second movement, preferably in the Upshaw version. But it’s worth listening to the whole symphony, and the 3rd movement ultimately is the most satisfying for me.

Given that several 4AD records have appeared on this blog so far, it’s worth noting that Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance) has also recorded a version of this symphony. Sadly, I’ve failed to find a record of this that sounds good, however.

This record is old skool ’60s “stereo”. Sounds aren’t spread around the sound field - rather, you have the whole band playing a bass/drums/guitar instrumental panned extreme right, while John Cale narrates a story panned left.

The first Velvet Underground LP, while being quite revolutionary at the time, has influenced so many acts that it kinda sounds pretty conventional now.  It took a long time to reach a wide audience, but it was accessible enough that, once enough people heard it, it became popular, and widely copied.

The second album is considerably less accessible. Side 2 is the noisy I Heard Her Call My Name (a track that’s basically the template for acts like The Jesus and Mary Chain), and the rambling Sister Ray, while a large chunk of side 1 is taken up by this track, The Gift.

In some ways I prefer White Light/White Heat to the début “The Velvet Underground and Nico”. The first record is the one that inspired thousands of bands and produced a shed load of cover versions, but WL/WH has an edge that still sounds pretty contemporary in parts, 50+ years on.

In “The Gift”, Waldo wants to meet his now-remote girlfriend, and he found that the only way he could afford it was to pack himself in a box and send himself through the post.  Marsha received the package, and declared “Oh God, it’s from Waldo, that schmuck!”

She has trouble opening the package, but finds a large sheet metal cutter. After a struggle, she (and I quote):

> “plunged the long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the centre of Waldo Jeffers’ head, which split slightly, and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun.”

Prefab Sprout were a pretty popular band in the 80s that, to be honest, I didn’t really like that much.

In 2019, this album  was re-released under the Prefab Sprout banner.

let article = """
In the late 90s, McAloon was rendered almost blind after suffering detached retinas.  Left housebound, he recorded chat shows, phone-ins and documentaries from radio (“trawling the MHz”), and cut them up to provide source material for the album.

The album is largely instrumental, with classical instrumentation. This music was pieced together with some of the radio samples, and this 22 minute title track dominates the record. Throughout the track, Yvonne Connors, speaking in a soft spoken-word voice, tells a fictional life story, constructed from the radio samples and edited together into a narrative.

In 2019, a remastered version of the LP was released under the Prefab Sprout monicker.

This is the song that actually triggered the idea of doing a songs blog.  I declared on Twitter (back when that was a thing) that this is a song that I felt I could never truly tire of, and that inspired the idea of a “Songs I’ll Never Tire Of” blog. The crap blog name held me back from actually starting something, but eventually I got around to it, renamed it, and here we are. 

This tune was released after R.E.M.’s popularity peak, but to me it still stands out as the highlight track from a pretty-decent catalogue.

"""

let article = """
From the start of their career in the early 80s up to sixth album Green in 1988, R.E.M. showed a steady growth artistically, and in popularity.

1991’s Out Of Time record took them to worldwide stardom, based mainly on the single Losing My Religion, while 1992’s Automatic For The People was a considerably stronger and more consistent record, I’d say.

Next up was the mixed bag “Monster”, which was promoted by a world tour, unlike its two predecessors.  Songs for what would become the tenth album “New Adventures in Hi-Fi” were previewed on this tour, and some of the recording took place on the road.

E-Bow The Letter is one of those tracks that record companies tend not to want to put out as a single, for fear of not getting airplay. But R.E.M. were big enough by now that they could put out anything and get it played, so putting out their best track, even if it’s not your usual “single” material, made sense.

The title is in two parts. The ^link(ebow) (spelled as E-Bow by the band) is a hand-held device to stimulate the strings of a guitar. It gives you “infinite sustain” - you still use the fretboard to determine what note you play, but the EBow applies an electromagnetic force to the string to keep it ringing for as long as you hold it close to the string. It’s used on this record, obviously, and you can see Peter Buck playing it in the official video.

The second part of the title, “The Letter”, refers to a fictional letter from Michael Stipe to actor River Phoenix, who died a few years before.  

The single and LP recording features Patti Smith performing a vocal part in the chorus. In live shows, that part would also be sung by others, including Radiohead’s Thom Yorke.

A side-effect of my love for this record is that it is *literally* impossible for me to hear mention of Maria Callas without responding “whoever she is?”. It’s a small price to pay for a song this great.

Flux is her third solo LP, following Sleeping Patterns (2008), and The Crush (2011), and I think it’s her best solo work so far.

This track comes from 2016, the wonderful year where my annual “best-of” mix tape was one of the greatest I can remember. Paper Thin is by Laura Kidd, who was then using the She Makes War project name, and features Tanya Donelly on BVs.

"""

let article = """
I first came across Laura Kidd, aka She Makes War, when she appeared on stage with Tanya Donelly (formerly of Throwing Muses, Belly, Breeders, and solo), who was playing a set in support of the current line-up of Throwing Muses.   Laura sang backing vocals on the Belly track ^link(slow-dog) at their 2014 show in a church in Bristol.

She is a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, with five albums as She Makes War. She also plays bass in the live bands for other artists, including Tricky, Viv Albertine and The Penelopes.

Her 2016 album Direction of Travel is a wonderful record in a variety of styles. There are some fine rockers, such as the single ^link(cold-shoulder), but this song is a quieter affair, mostly just voice and ukulele, with the addition of strings here and there for extra texture.   The lyrics and beautiful melody work so well without elaborate decoration - but the addition of Donelly’s backing vocals are the perfect icing on this cake.  

The She Makes War phase of Kidd’s career now seems to be done. She released a final LP, “And Peace”, in 2020 - re-recordings of songs from her career (including a re-take on Paper Thin). She is now recording as Penfriend, releasing ^link(everything) last month. 

The Penfriend project includes a “Correspondent’s Club” membership scheme, with free and paid-for tiers. This seems to be a good way of supporting artists you love, I’m also a member of Strange Angels (Throwing Muses/Kristin Hersh/Fifty Foot Wave) and the membership scheme of The Joy Formidable.

### Attention Engineer

I have long planned to do a series here on my favourite songs of 2016, including this one. The series will follow along soon, but I pushed this one up the list after listening to the first two episodes of Laura’s ^link(attention-engineer).  In this series she interviews other artists, kicking off with two that she has collaborated with. Episode 1 features the aforementioned Tanya Donelly, while she talks to Mark Chadwick of The Levellers in Episode 2.

Both are great interviews, providing some laughs while also producing genuinely interesting insights. One subject that cropped up in both of the opening episodes are critique of an artist’s work.  Kidd and Donelly talk about how how time changes who you listen to when critiquing your work, and whose views matter to you.  Chadwick took the subject further, in a direction I didn’t expect, to be honest - lamenting the loss of the professional critic (who he admits he didn’t appreciate at all in the past), since the demise of the music press.

Episode 3, which I hope to catch up with tomorrow, features Ayse Hassan (Savages).  Episode 4 featuring Frank Turner landed on 10th June 2020.

Chew Lips looked like they could be on their way to stardom at one point, but sadly it wasn’t to be. One critically acclaimed album and a few singles are all we have, which is a great loss for all of us.

"""

let article = """
There was quite a buzz around Chew Lips when they started performing as a three-piece, and a few singles on Kitsuné records brought them rave reviews and some mainstream airplay. The début LP Unicorn came out in early 2010, and it was during the promotion of this record that I saw them for, sadly, the only time. They did an in-store show in the basement of a clothes shop in Cabots Circus, Bristol.  It was a great performance, especially given the restricting nature of the venue.

Singer Tigs was far from the first vocalist to be compared to Debbie Harry, but there’s more substance to that comparison here.  Her voice and mannerisms when performing seemed to owe something to her illustrious predecessor.

I don’t know how well Unicorn sold, but it got some good reviews, and attracted the attention of major label Sony, who signed them up for their second LP.  This is where things seemed to get more difficult.  Will Sanderson moved on, but there were bigger problems ahead - Tigs had some serious health issues which she has subsequently talked about in ^link(interview).

A couple of singles were released on Sony, but it became clear from band tweets that relationships were strained with the major. It appears that a second LP got recorded, but never saw the light of day.

Tigs subsequently announced that the band was over and she would be concentrating on writing for other artists.

If you like this, there are a few remixes, and an acoustic version, linked below. All worth checking out, I suggest.

This EP came out soon after the untitled Throwing Muses début album, and by that time I’m already thinking that they could be, for me, *The Best Band In The World. Ever.*

They retain that status to this day.

let article = """
The first LP - which we treated as eponymous until 2003 when another LP called “Throwing Muses” was released, and the band declared that the 1986 one was actually untitled  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ - came across my radar via an interview in Melody Maker by Chris Roberts.  They sounded interesting, and his enthusiasm got me interested. Given the number of other acts that we shared a love for, I bought the first LP, play it once, think “crikey”, and put it aside. Thankfully I gave it another few plays a week later and then it hit home what a special record by a remarkable band this was.

Chains Changed was a four-track EP that formed the next release, ahead of the band’s appearance with ^link(fish) on the 4AD compilation that brought them to a wider audience.

Finished (embedded above) is the stand-out track for me, but all four are pretty amazing.

Next up was Reel. Unlike the other three tracks by Kristin Hersh, this one was penned by Tanya Donelly, who would later leave to form Belly and have a solo career (via a stint in The Breeders).

After Snailhead, there’s Cry Baby Cry. This is Hersh’s song, not The Beatles track of the same name. Though Throwing Muses did cover the latter later, as a B-side.

If you don’t know this band, please give Finished a listen. I can’t guarantee you’ll like it, but I can guarantee  you’ve not heard anything else quite like this.

United Crushers was Poliça’s third LP, and there’s a distinct tweak in style in each record, while still being clearly the same band.  Early material used an effect where Channy’s vocals where doubled, both live and on record, by mixing in an autotuned version along with the “real” vocal. It was distinctive, and I liked it, but it wasn’t to everyone’s taste.  The autotune takes a back seat here, and this gives the track a more conventional vocal sound.

But there’s still plenty about this track that is distinctly Poliça - the two live drummers, along with sequenced electronic drums and synths.  In a ^link(live-context), the line-up is vocals, bass, and two drummers.

Also, check out the video, as embedded above. I think it’s quite beautiful.  The images are mostly totally blown-out, highly over-exposed. This imagery reflects the song’s apparent subject - Channy’s feelings of being in the ^link(limelight).

After leaving the Bunnymen, McCulloch released a couple of non-remarkable solo LPs, before forming Electrafixion with Bunnyman Will Sergeant. This new band produced a way better LP in my view.

This lead single was, somehow, simultaneously “a new start” and “picking up where they left off”. It’s *exactly* what you would want from an Echo & The Bunnymen reunion single.

### An aside

The original line-up of the band was McCulloch, Will Sergeant, and Les Pattinson, playing along with a drum machine (sometimes described as the eponymous “Echo”). They did a famous Peel session in this format, but hit more widespread popularity after they recruited a “real” drummer Pete de Freitas. 

One feature of this band is that they didn’t put the drummer at the back, out of the way. In live shows, the four were usually set up side-by-side, with de Freitas on the left or right, but definitely toward the front.

He was the brother of Rose and Rachael de Freitas of The Heart Throbs, who were featured earlier on this site - though Rachael had left by the recording of the song I featured, ^link(tiny-feet).  De Freitas passed away after a motorcycle accident in 1989.

This isn’t the first version of Sweet Jane, of course. It’s not even a *typical* version by Reed solo, or as part of The Velvent Underground. But it _is_ really quite stunning.  What really makes this, though, is the intro penned by Steve Hunter - and Hunter’s band, which subsequently went on to back Alice Cooper.

let article = """
The video embedded above uses the audio from the Lou Reed live LP Rock ’n’ Roll Animal, in which he was backed by Hunter and Dick Wagner on guitars, Prakash John on bass, Ray Colcord on keys, and Pentti Glan on drums. As you can hear, it’s quite a band.  The video in the clip looks like it comes from the same show, though it loops a short clip over the intro, until Reed joins the band on stage for the vocal.

The duelling solos of Hunter and Wagner are clearly a highlight, but everyone else is putting in a pretty decent shift too here.  I guess it seems odd to talk about an iconic song in terms of a bolted-on intro that’s not really part of that song, but this is so great you can argue that it has become the definitive version. As it happens, Reed himself has been quoted as describing a very different version as has favourite - he particularly liked the take released in the 80s by ^link(cowboy-junkies).

The song, penned by Reed of course, first appeared on the fourth Velvet Underground LP Loaded. It has, as long as I can remember, been a staple of Reed’s live shows up until his death in 2013, and he opened most shows with it.

He later played the song ^link(steve-hunter), who reprised some of the lines from the Rock ’n’ Roll Animal intro, but it falls a but flat in my view.

Shortly after sample-heavy Hot Doggie by Colourbox appeared on the 4AD Compilation “Lonely Is An Eyesore”, the label released a collaborative single between Colourbox and label-mates AR Kane as a Double A-Side. The result was less of a collaboration than intended. One side was nearly all AR Kane, the other side was nearly all Colourbox. It was the latter side that got the airplay, and that took the song to the top of the UK Charts.

"""

let article = """
Pump Up The Volume is even more sample-heavy than Hot Doggie, but takes its source material mostly from other songs rather than from film/TV and therein lies the source of so much trouble. Sued by Stock, Aitken and Waterman (SAW) for a relatively minor sample from their song ^link(roadblock), the artists who made this record reportedly ended up without a penny from the hit UK release.

The name M|A|R|R|S came from the members of the collab - Martin Young (Colourbox), Alex Ayuli, Rudy Tambala, Russell Smith (AR Kane), and Steve Young (Colourbox).  The only significant radio play was of the mainly-Colourbox side Pump Up The Volume, rather than the mainly AR Kane side Anitina.

The title of Pump Up The Volume comes from a sample taken from I Know You Got Sould by Eric B. & Rakim.

The song is basically a repeating ^link(tr909) beat with a near-constant bass-line and very little other harmonic content. There’s an occasional Aminor piano stab, but the “top line” doesn’t come from the instrumentation - it comes  from the samples of other songs.

Which samples you hear depends on which version you listen to.  Clearance wasn’t obtained in advance, and different countries ended up with different sample combinations. Even in the UK, there were mixes with samples added/removed. The ^link(wiki) article has a good diagram of which versions contain which samples.

The main UK release included samples from ^link(roadblock) which resulted in the legal issues - even though the original had plagiarised from others. The courts distinguished between sampling and plagiarism, and SAW won, taking all the royalties from the hit single. It’s surely right that some payment had to be made, but 100% seems a tad excessive.

People learned from this - after this record, if you wanted to legally sample, say, ^link(soft-cell), you would get someone to record a new snippet that sounded exactly like a sample would. But you no longer had to pay performing rights to Soft Cell. You’d still have to pay the publishers (usually the songwriter - who weren’t Soft Cell, it was Ed Cobb).  We ended up with a situation where people were copying the sound of that particular cover but the people who created that sound got nothing.

Anyway, what’s more important for the purposes of this blog is that Pump Up The Volume still sounds amazing.

### An aside

Check out the original release of ^link(gloria-jones), from 1964.

Continuing the theme of sample-based tracks, next up is Spitfire, by Public Service Broadcasting. The song would work absolutely fine as an instrumental, but the samples from the 1942 film “The First of the Few” add so much more.

"""

let article = """
Calling this song “sample-based” is arguably wrong - there is heavy use of samples, but the core is a great instrumental piece, over which samples are based.   It’s more like a conventional song with the vocals replaced by snippets from the movie.

Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) started exclusively using instrumental music overlaid with samples from sources such as newsreel and public information films. The third LP Every Valley started using a few more “conventional” songs, with guest vocalists such as James Dean Bradfield and Tracyanne Campbell - though PSB’s J Willgoose Esq contributed half of a duet in one track, also featuring Lisa Jên Brown.

Spitfire is an early track and follows the instrumental+sample format. The samples come from ^link(first), a 1942 biographical film about ^link(mitchell), the designer of the famous ^link(spitfire) fighter that played a famous rôle in  WW2 - particularly the Battle of Britain, alongside the ^link(hurricane). Mitchell, sadly, passed away before he got to see the full success of his design.

This song comes from the first PSB LP “Inform - Educate - Entertain”, which featured songs covering a number of subjects. But the next two LPs where more strictly themed. 2015’s The Race for Space covered the space race from Sputnik (1957) to the last Apollo moon mission (1972).

This was followed in 2017 by Every Valley, which documents the decline of the coal mining industry in South Wales.   Sample-based songs use Coal Board adverts, or tales of the wives supporting their miner husbands during the Miner Strikes, though this record also includes singing performances from a number of contributors.

I strongly recommend all three LPs.

Despite the enduring popularity of songs like ^link(damaged-goods), and ^link(tourist), they never troubled the top 40 single or album charts. The latter single earned them an invite for a Top of the Pops appearance, which The Internet widely reports them as turning down when asked to change a lyric from “rubbers” to “rubbish”.  Oddly, I thought I could I remember seeing them on the show, but I can’t find evidence of it happening, so I’ll have to put it down as a false memory.

Refusing to compromise would have been totally in character. And most reports of this go on to blame it for the souring of their relationship with EMI, who had signed them up after a successful indie EP release.  The first album, ^link(entertainment), was a major critical success, though some fans preferred the less polished pre-EMI sound.  The band and label parted company after this one LP, though EMI haven’t been shy in coming forward with re-issues etc.

Outside the Trains Don’t Run on Time was released after Entertainment!, and appeared on their 2nd LP, the post-EMI ^link(solid-gold) record.  It did, however, get onto some re-issues of the first LP also.

My choice of Gang of Four track was really a short-list of two. I also nearly went for the slightly-later ^link(poverty). Check it out. I wouldn’t really call it “easy listening”, but I think it’ll be worth your time.

As the dying embers of punk faded, this new sound seemed like something we’d been waiting for - the next phase for pop/rock...

A big leap forwards while still being rooted in the present.


"""

let article = """
In some ways, it wasn’t really that new. It’s a rock record with drums, bass, and guitar. It adds synths, but they weren’t really that new, even in the mainstream. We already had Kraftwerk breaking through three years earlier, and dance music soon  embraced the technology, e.g. 1977’s I Feel Love by Donna Summer. But they were used differently here, and the combination of sounds, the vocal delivery, the visuals and marketing, all combined to make this a massive hit - not only sounding great in 1979, but also sounding great now, over 40 years later.

This was the second single from the second Tubeway Army LP *Replicas*. Gary Numan _was_ Tubeway Army, and further releases were billed under his own name, even though he initially retained Gardiner (bass) and Lidyard (drums). Numan had played the other instrumentation, written the songs, produced the records, so the “solo” name made sense.

This came out in the spring of 1979. I was 17. I suspect most people of most ages find “the year when I was about 17” to be exciting musically, but in this year we had the likes of The Clash and The Stranglers moving on from punk origins to something more interesting, we had John Lydon moving on from the Sex Pistols with Public Image Limited, while the Two Tone scene introduced a new generation to Ska and gave us The Specials. The Jam had followed up All Mod Cons with Setting Sons. Talking Heads released Fear of Music, while Joy Division released the album-that-launched-a-billion shirts, Unknown Pleasures, and Gang of Four were taking the post-punk thing in whole new directions.

So this was quite a year, and yet this track _still_ stands out as something special.

The label marketed it with the new “technology” of picture disks, and the new sound/new look were made to be played on TV.  This was both diferent, and yet easily accessible. The vocal is kinda strange and understated, and yet is still rich and melodic. No wonder it was such a commercial success. I can’t believe it’s taken so long to get around to covering this track here!

Numan still performs this track of course, and I recommend his ^link(yt2013), which sets the standard for how to rework an old classic without ruining it.

### An aside

If, like me, you have wondered about the quotes around the word _friends_ in the title, Numan explains the song’s subject matter, which clears this up.

> The lyrics came from short stories I’d written about what London would be like in 30 years. These machines – “friends” – come to the door. They supply services of various kinds, but your neighbours never know what they really are since they look human. The one in the song is a prostitute, hence the inverted commas. It was released in May 1979 and sold a million copies. I had a No 1 single with a song about a robot prostitute and no one knew.

The Safari EP marks the transition from the raw Albini-produced early Breeders material, such as their début LP Pod and the more polished (and commercially successful) follow-up The Last Splash.

"""

let article = """
The Breeders formed as an “indie supergroup” of sorts.  Led by Kim Deal of The Pixies, and featuring Tanya Donelly (Throwing Muses, later Belly) and Josephine Wiggs (The Perfect Disaster).

During the recording of ^link(pod), Deal and Donelly remained with their  “main” bands. Pixies were between Doolittle and Bossanova, while Throwing Muses had released Hunkpapa but not yet their relatively commercially successful fourth LP The Real Ramona) - the last to feature Donelly until 2003.

Pod was produced by Steve Albini, whose style suited the raw, basic, nature of the songs, mostly penned by Kim Deal.  At the time, the band hinted that the second Breeders album would be based around Tanya Donelly songs, but instead she left to form her own band Belly, while Deal recruited her twin sister Kelley, and the result was the hit record ^link(last-splash).

The Safari EP, released between Pod and Last Splash marks the transition - not least because it still features Tanya Donelly, while introducing Kelley Deal. It’s also a transition sonically, with the title track sounding more like Pod, while ^link(do-you-love-me-now) points the way forwards to Last Splash.

Those two tracks also happen to be two of my favourite Breeders tracks, so, failing to decide which to use, I decided to include the whole EP. The record also includes ^link(dont-call-home) and a cover of The Who’s ^link(so-sad-about-us).

Writing about the Safari EP by The Breeders reminded me that I had long planned to mention this song for a while. It’s by far my favourite song by The Beatles - the connection with The Breeders is that they did an ok cover on their first LP Pod.

let article = """
Lennon apparently took the title of the song from an NRA magazine - “I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something”. The magazine itself was paraphrasing the title of a Charles M Schultz book “Happiness Is A Warm Puppy”.

The meaning of the metaphorical gun in the song has been interpreted as being about heroin (after all, the lyric includes the phrase “I need a fix...”), or about sex. 

This is one of those songs constructed from various disparate ideas glued together. The song changes key and time signature on a whim.  The song tends to be considered to be split into five sections:

 * Intro, “She’s not a girl who misses much”.
 * The band joins in, “She’s well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand”
 * “I need a fix ’cause I’m going down”
 * “Mother Superior jumped the gun”
 * The “doo wop” section (“Bang bang shoot shoot” etc)
 
 The Mother Superior section is the most complex rythmically. 
 
 This is a song where the “parts” are all pretty interesting, and yet summing them together adds a extra layer of interest on top.  For me, by far the finest hour (well 3 minutes) of The Beatles.

Hersh made her name as the singer/songwriter of Throwing Muses, but also carved out a solo career - the latter mostly being gentler, more acoustic, material.

While the line-up is similar, the sound isn’t that close.  50 Foot Wave started as a way-harder rocking outfit, kicking off with  an eponymous EP in 2004 and the Golden Ocean LP a year or so later.

So Kim Deal put together a new line-up to record her latest songs, and performed these initially as Tammy and The Amps, soon shortening this to The Amps.

It’s time to get up-to-date and look at a few of 2021’s offerings.  Two of the highlights this year have each been collabs between two groups/artists that I already love.

Kicking us off with this mini-series is Like I Used To, a charming piece of alt-Country from singer-songwriters Sharon Van Etten and Angel Olsen.

"""

let article = """
Released in May, this track started as an idea from Van Etten that she handed to Jagjaguwar label-mate Olsen to work on.  The two do their own verses solo, but the harmonies that they sing together in the pre-chorus and chorus work so well, considering the quite-different vocal sounds of each singer.

On the studio version, there’s a Grandaddy-style synth-piano arpeggio that comes in a few times, e.g. at about ^link(arp-at-1-32).  It’s a detail that isn’t required to make it a great song - yet it adds a lovely extra layer on top.

In the video embedded above, look out for Abba-style shots where one singer is face on and the other side on. You’ll know what I mean when you see it. Not least because it’s in the current video thumbnail :)

This is my second 2021 collab offering - like the previous one, this features two very different voices that combine so well.

Here, Chvrches work with Robert Smith of The Cure to produce a track that is greater than the sum of its parts - even though its parts are great alone. 

This is definitely one of my favourite tracks of the year so far.

"""

let article = """
2021 sees the release of the fourth LP by Chvrches, and the first track released to the public, the heavily-autotuned ^link(he-said-she-said) was, in my view, fairly underwhelming.

But the second teaser from the LP raised the stakes somewhat - a tremendous collaboration with Robert Smith of The Cure. It’s amazing - currently my next favourite Chvrches track after the iconic ^link(clearest-blue) from their 2nd LP Every Open Eye (2015).

When touring their 3rd LP Love Is Dead, Chvrches added a live drummer to their setup. I wasn’t convinced it improved the sound at all. That doesn’t mean I want everything to be programmed, there was just something about that particular combo that didn’t work for me.

I think the drums here are programmed, and there is an electronic element to the backing, but there is well-played live bass, piano, and guitar to help this groove along nicely.

The previous track on this blog, ^link(like-i-used-to), referred to two very different voices working so well together. Here we have the same - but even more so.

Highlight of the year so far.

Recorded for the Shaking Through project, this song was written around the time of the 2017 Waxatchee LP “Out in the Storm”.

Like most Waxahatchee songs, it combines simple chords with sweet melody, but in this case a slicker-than-usual production elevates it above the norm.


"""

let article = """
Waxahatchee is the project name for songer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield. At this time she had a steady band line up featuring twin sister Allison (guitar, keys, BVs), along with Katherine Simonetti (bass), and Ashley Arnwine (drums), though Allison does not appear on this recording.

There is a ^link(documentary) about the recording of this song, in which the band seems to imply that this would be part of Out in the Storm. However, it never made it and was a standalone single only.

Crutchfield’s songs are rarely complex in terms of chord structures. It’s rare for her to venture far beyond diatonic Major/minor and this song is basically  ^chord(I) ^chord(V) ^chord(IV) in the verse and ^chord(ii) ^chord(IV) ^chord(V) ^chord(I) in the chorus.   But it’s always the melody that makes the song with Waxahatchee.

One of the great benefits of being relatively simple is that a song can easily adapt to different interpretations. “La Loose”, for example, from 2015’s Ivy Tripp, was releaseed in  ^link(la-loose-electronic) form, but also works well ^link(la-loose-acoustic), and in an ^link(la-loose-indie).

Sadly, I write this on the day we learn that Sinéad O’Connor has passed away.

I talked about her covers earlier in this blog, but she was a tremendous songwriter in her own right.  I became a committed fan when I saw her at a festival in 1994 or maybe 1995 when she was promoting Universal Mother, having previously only known her own song Mandinka, and Nothing Compares 2 U, the cover that made her famous.

I was knocked over by this performance of melodic music somehow influenced by folk and dub at the same time.

"""

let article = """
This track is the final climax of Universal Mother. It has a folky melodic feel, but with a reggae-driven bassline. Her band at this time were awesome, including long-time collaborators John Reynolds on drums, and Clare Kenny on bass.

Reynolds was O’Connor’s producer, and musical director for live shows. And indeed he was also her ex-husband (presumably the person referred to in another favourite, ^link(this-is-the-last-day-of-our-acquaintance)).  He remained in her bands until the end, and is credited as co-writer with O’Connor on this track.

The song is based on her then recent breakup with Peter Gabriel.

B-side was a 13-minute remix of ^link(fire-in-babylon), another track from Universal Mother. I've not heard this remix, but the idea of a 13-minute version of that song certainly whets the appetite, so I'll be checking it out.

RIP Sinéad O’Connor 1966-2023
