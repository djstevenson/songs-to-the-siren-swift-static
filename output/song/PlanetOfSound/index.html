A load of tracks about space and aliens - a theme pervasive enough that some called it a “concept album”.</p><p>Pixies have more sophisticated songs than this, but this has an energy and some fine lyrics that elevate it towards the upper end of their output.</p><p>An aside: The first time I saw them play was 1st May 1988 at the Town and Country Club, in Kentish Town, London. A truly magical night, they "co-headlined" (supported) Throwing Muses who were promoting their magnificent second album “House Tornado”.</p></div></div><nav class="col-12 nav-location-bottom"><p class="float-md-left float-sm-none">« <a href="/song/NumberOneSongInHeaven/">Number One Song in Heaven</a> «</p><p class="float-md-right float-sm-none">» <a href="/song/ClearestBlue/">Clearest Blue</a> »</p></nav></section></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
