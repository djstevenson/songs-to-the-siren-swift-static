The music press was raving about them to a crazy degree, and they couldn't possibly live up to the hype. Then they actually released a record and the "hype" turned out to be bang on.  Having said that, I don't think they came up with anything as good as this again until the epic Weekender (more on that later on this blog, for sure).</p><p>Critics would dismiss them as a southern copy of Happy Mondays. Although that seemed unfair, the presence of the Bez-like Barry Mooncult in their live setup certainly contributed to that popular view.</p><p>The video for this is great, just a band miming to their track about scoring and dealing drugs and that, while cute kids and dogs dance around. It didn't get aired much at the time but it remains one of my favourite pop videos.</p><p>Sadly, their openness to drugs brought about their demise. Literally. Singer Liam Maher, and his guitarist brother Joe were to die young from heroin overdoses.</p><p>Don't do drugs kids.</p></div></div><div class="links"><h4>Links</h4><p><ul class="link-list"><li class="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/fGPTVRGqfeo"><img src="/icons/youtube-1x.png" alt="youtube icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/youtube-3x.png 3x, /icons/youtube-4x.png 4x, /icons/youtube-2x.png 2x, /icons/youtube-1x.png 1x"><span class="link-description">It's On - Flowered Up</span></a></li><li class="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/n05kCd6o6Mo"><img src="/icons/youtube-1x.png" alt="youtube icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/youtube-3x.png 3x, /icons/youtube-4x.png 4x, /icons/youtube-1x.png 1x, /icons/youtube-2x.png 2x"><span class="link-description">It's On (faster album version) - Flowered Up</span></a></li></ul></p></div><footer class="col-12"><p class="song-tags">Tags: <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm song-tag" href="/tag/decade1990s.html" role="button">1990s</a><a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm song-tag" href="/tag/drugs.html" role="button">Drugs</a><a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm song-tag" href="/tag/hype.html" role="button">Hype</a><a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm song-tag" href="/tag/indieDance.html" role="button">Indie/Dance</a><a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm song-tag" href="/country/uk.html" role="button">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</a></p><p class="metadata">Published at Fri, 24 April 2020 20:22</p></footer><nav class="col-12 nav-location-bottom"><p class="float-md-left float-sm-none">Â« <a href="/song/FlowersOfRomance.html">Flowers of Romance</a> Â«</p><p class="float-md-right float-sm-none">Â» <a href="/song/SomethingGood08.html">Something Good '08</a> Â»</p></nav></section></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
