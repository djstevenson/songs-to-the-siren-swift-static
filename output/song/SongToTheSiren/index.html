Although it's a cover, this is the most famous version and, I'd claim, the definitive version.</p><p>Recorded by Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie of 4AD act Cocteau Twins, this was released on the B-side of a 12" release, then the A-side of a 7", before appearing on the first This Mortal Coil album <em>It'll End in Tears</em></p></div><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HFWKJ2FUiAQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div><p>This Mortal Coil was a music collective led by Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the British record label <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD" target="_blank">4AD</a>, and featuring a wide variety of artists, many of which were already part of acts signed to that label.</p><p>The TMC project kicked off with a re-recording of a pair of Modern English songs, which appeared as a medley on the A-side of a 12" release. The B-side tracks included this version of Song to the Siren. It subsequently became the A-side of a 7" release.</p><p>This recording features Liz Fraser and Robin Guthrie, both of 4AD band Cocteau Twins.</p><p>The original recordings were made in the 1960s by Tim Buckley, this song being written by him and collaborator Larry Beckett.</p><p>There are a few different recordings by Buckley, and this cover fairly closely follows the version on <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/cZiTSglLM-4" target="_blank">Starsailor LP</a>, with the addition of Fraser's distinctive vocal style. Buckley had played the song live a few years earlier on <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/vMTEtDBHGY4" target="_blank">The Monkees Show</a>.</p><p>There is a haunting quality to the recording, which well matches the lyrics - about a possibly unrequited love, presented in terms of a sailor being drawn onto the rocks by the siren.</p><h3>Other versions</h3><p>The song has seen many covers over the years, from <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/Gw9ANFOuMBU" target="_blank">Robert Plant</a> to <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/jjk2L5BFq1A" target="_blank">Half Man Half Biscuit</a>, from <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/vDIvTCweoCw" target="_blank">George Michael</a> to <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/G5nbn4-iwPY" target="_blank">Wolf Alice</a>. George Michael follows the This Mortal Coil version so closely he even gets the same lyrics wrong (it should be "were you fox when I was hare?"). Robert Plant's take on the song is a spectacular error of judgement. It's truly appalling.</p><p>The versions by Wolf Alice and <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/88wL8oRf45U" target="_blank">Sin√©ad O'Connor</a> are my favourites after This Mortal Coil. O'Connor's version was released on a 2010 compilation of music from Irish Artists, before appearing as a bonus track on the iTunes release of How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?</p><h3>See also</h3><p>This Mortal Coil would later cover another Buckley song - <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/01o6AB8MKyg" target="_blank">Morning Glory</a> appeared on the second TMC album Filigree &amp; Shadow, with lead vocals by Louise Rutkowski.</p></div><div><h5>Not exists</h5><h5><a id="song-2" class="link" href="../Supervixen/index.html">Supervixen</a></h5></div><div><h4>Tags</h4><ul><li><a class="tag-link" href="../../tag/fourAD/index.html">4AD</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="../../tag/cover/index.html">Cover</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="../../tag/decade1980s/index.html">1980s</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="../../tag/lizFraser/index.html">Liz Fraser</a></li></ul></div><div><h4>Origin</h4><ul><li><a class="country-link" href="../../country/uk/index.html">üá¨üáß</a></li></ul></div><div><h4>Links</h4><ul><li><a id="link-official" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFWKJ2FUiAQ" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - This Mortal Coil (official)</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/01o6AB8MKyg" target="_blank">Morning Glory - This Mortal Coil</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/vMTEtDBHGY4" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Tim Buckley, live on ‚ÄúThe Monkees‚Äù</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/cZiTSglLM-4" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Tim Buckley, studio version on Starsailor (1970)</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/G5nbn4-iwPY" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Wolf Alice</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/88wL8oRf45U" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Sin√©ad O'Connor</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/jjk2L5BFq1A" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Half Man Half Biscuit</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/vDIvTCweoCw" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - George Michael</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/Gw9ANFOuMBU" target="_blank">Song to the Siren - Robert Plant (do not click on this)</a></li><li><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD" target="_blank">4AD (wikipedia)</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
