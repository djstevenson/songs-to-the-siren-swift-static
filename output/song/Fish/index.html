Some of their finest stuff isn't that easily accessible - but this is the song I'd use to introduce a new listener. It's  After their début album Throwing Muses, and in a highly-productive era before the follow up House Tornado, the band produced some of their finest work  - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed" target="_blank">Chains Changed EP</a>, the Fat Skier mini-album, and this track - their contribution to the 4AD compilation album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Is_an_Eyesore" target="_blank">Lonely Is an Eyesore</a>.</p><p>If you've been in the same room as me when my phone has gone off, and I've forgotten to put it on silent, you've heard the intro to this song - I sampled it for my ring tone. In retrospect, this wasn't a good idea. If listening to my music on shuffle in the car, when I hear this I have an inevitable moment about confusion over whether it's just the song or I have a phone call.</p><h3>An aside</h3><p>Going back to my opening point about what track you'd play first to someone who doesn't know your favourite band: I had a conversation with my (then) boss at work when I booked time off to follow a mini-tour of the UK by Throwing Muses. He didn't know the band, so fired up Spotify, listened to 30 seconds of the "most popular" track and said "It's a bit 90s, isn't it?" and hit stop.</p><p>I relate this anecdote cos the track recommended by Spotify was <a href="https://youtu.be/=RZI-FTcFtn8" target="_blank">Not Too Soon</a>, a massively untypical track by a different singer and writer than the main body of work. I quite like the song, but as any aficionado of any band will tell you, don't start with the most popular song. A Radiohead nut isn't going to kick you off with Creep, and a New Order fan won't start you on Blue Monday.</p><p>Oh, and Not Too Soon was released in 1990. So sound 1990s isn't the insult he was looking for :)</p><p>If anyone reading this listens to Fish and likes it, and wants to hear more - just <a href="https://twitter.com/hoagy_ytfc" target="_blank">ask me</a> or search for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed" target="_blank">Chains Changed EP</a>.</p></div></div><div class="links"><h4>Links</h4><p><ul class="link-list"><li class="youtube"><a class="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIYkd9nJLJA"><img src="/icons/youtube-1x.png" alt="youtube icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/youtube-2x.png 2x, /icons/youtube-4x.png 4x, /icons/youtube-1x.png 1x, /icons/youtube-3x.png 3x"><span class="link-description">Fish - Throwing Muses</span></a></li><li class="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/=RZI-FTcFtn8"><img src="/icons/youtube-1x.png" alt="youtube icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/youtube-2x.png 2x, /icons/youtube-3x.png 3x, /icons/youtube-4x.png 4x, /icons/youtube-1x.png 1x"><span class="link-description">Not Too Soon - Throwing Muses</span></a></li><li class="wikipedia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chains_Changed"><img src="/icons/wikipedia-1x.png" alt="wikipedia icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/wikipedia-1x.png 1x, /icons/wikipedia-4x.png 4x, /icons/wikipedia-2x.png 2x, /icons/wikipedia-3x.png 3x"><span class="link-description">Chains Changed EP - Throwing Muses</span></a></li><li class="wikipedia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Is_an_Eyesore"><img src="/icons/wikipedia-1x.png" alt="wikipedia icon" height="32" width="32" srcset="/icons/wikipedia-4x.png 4x, /icons/wikipedia-3x.png 3x, /icons/wikipedia-2x.png 2x, /icons/wikipedia-1x.png 1x"><span class="link-description">Lonely Is an Eyesore - 4AD compilation</span></a></li></ul></p></div><nav class="col-12 nav-location-bottom"><p class="float-md-left float-sm-none">« <a href="/song/INeedSomeFineWineAndYouYouNeedToBeNicer/">I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer</a> «</p><p class="float-md-right float-sm-none">» <a href="/song/WeCanWorkItOut/">We Can Work It Out</a> »</p></nav></section></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
